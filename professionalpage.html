            <dt> Volunteer Librarian at Torit Montessori Schools</dt>
            <dd> <i>Boston, Massachusetts </i></dd>
            <dd> January 2024-Present</dd>
            <dd> In my role as a volunteer librarian, I worked with another volunteer librarian to rearrange the physical space and organization of the school library. 
                <br> We sorted and weeded existing materials and donated materials, then categorized and classified the remaining books to meet student and teacher searching needs. We also implemented tools and structures to support independent student use of the library.

            <dd> In my role as an intern in the Massachusetts DCR Plans Library, I worked on a digitization project. I used a QAQC tool to review and approve digital images to be used in a database.

I created item-level cataloging records for forest and land surveys as well as land plans.</dd>

            <dd> As an intern at Witness to Mass Incarceration, I researched and composed grant applications to support the annual Suitcase Sunday event as well as general functions. I also utilized Excel to manage a record of potential grant applications, their requirements, and which interns were working on each grant application. I facilitated interoffice communication through email and Slack and communicated with our manager on behalf of the development team. I also assissted in a community outreach event by communicating with constituent business and nonprofit leaders about their attendance and needs for the event.</dd>
