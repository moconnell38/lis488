          <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p class="indent"> I am currently a masters student of library and information science at Simmons University in Boston, Massachusetts. I am in the archives management concentration.
             I grew up in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, just outside of Worcester, and am currently living in Brookline, Massachusetts. I did my undergraduate degree at Fordham University Rose Hill, in the Bronx, New York. </p>
            <p class="indent">My professional interests include archives, cataloging, and metadata creation. I am particularly interested in the role of libraries, archives, and museums in rerpesenting marginalized and traditionally underrepresented communities. I also have an interest in digital stewardship and digitization initiatives in libraries, archives, and museums. I have experience working in government archives as well. </p>

            <h2> Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p class="indent"> Like many library science students and professionals, I am an avid reader. My favorite books are the <i> Beartown Trilogy</i> by Fredrik Backman. A recent favorite is Danielle McGuire's <i> At the Dark End of the Street. </i>
            You can often find me at a museum or bookstore in my free time. My favorites around Boston are the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and Brookline Booksmith!
            I have also been practicing yoga for many years, enjoy baking, and love animals! My favorite things to bake usually have chocolate in them but I also enjoy pie making.
            I greatly enjoy the outdoors. I grew up visiting my grandparent's farm and love gardening! I also enjoy biking.
