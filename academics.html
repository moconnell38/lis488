            <h2>Undergraduate Thesis</h2>
            <p class="indent">As part of my undergraduate coursework, I completed an undergraduate thesis in the American Studies Department. The thesis was entitled <span style="font-style: italic;"> <a href="readingincarceration.pdf">Reading Incarceration: Chicano Contributions to U.S. Prison Literature in the 1960s and 1970s </a></span> 
                <h3>Abstract</h3>
 </p>
            <p class="indent"> Prison literature, which has long been the near exclusive work of those writers incarcerated for their political and religious beliefs- underwent a major transformation under the guidance of prison organizing and abolition movements. These largely Black-led movements instigated reflective prison writings that challenged the mainstream conceptions of guilt and crime. Moreover, they critiqued the conditions and legitimacy of incarceration. As prison organizing peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s, so too did the Chicano Movement. This paper examines the contributions of the Chicano movement to the prison literature movement, specifically the subgenre of Pinto poetry. Mexican-American incarcerated poets echoed the themes of Black incarcerated authors in positioning prison as an intensified microcosm of a larger American society. They centered their analyses on immigration, border crossing, and collective identity. This paper specifically  uses the works of Jimmy Santiago Baca and Ricardo Sanchez to investigate these themes. </p>
